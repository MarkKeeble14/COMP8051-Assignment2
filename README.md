## Version 0.1 - iOS + OpenGL ES

Game.cpp is where you should program the game itself.
Swift just initializes the whole thing and passes in input events.

Coming Soon<sup>TM</sup>:
- Textures
- Actual Lights
- Fog
- Unity-style Behaviour system for gameobjects.
- Properly decoupling geometry from gameobjects.

P.S. "Alex" is the username on a Mac I had to borrow to work on this.
